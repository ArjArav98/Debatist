# Debatist
Debatist is a web application which lets users create, edit and share notes. The application was built with the primary objective being to make preparation for debates between teammates easier. A team member can create a note for a specific debate and then give access his/her teammates (who must be registered on the network) to view and edit these notes. However, this application does not necessarily have to be only for debate, but it can be used for other purposes too.

## Getting Started
Since Debatist is not online (I know, I know, it's a web application which isn't online), if you'd like to use it and if you happen to have a server of your own, you are very much free to download these files and launch the application. Also, make sure you download the SQL schemas and install those tables properly.

For those who would just like to check it out to see how it works, you'll need the following tools first.
* [WAMP](http://www.wampserver.com/en/) or XAMPP(https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) - Installing one of these is reccomended if you don't already have them on your computer. They come with both a web server and an SQL server, which is basically all that we need.

### Launching the Application (for XAMPP)
1. Download these files and move them into the ```htdocs``` folder which is located inside the ```XAMPP``` folder. This folder will be in ```C://``` in Windows and ```Applications``` in Mac.
2. Launch the XAMPP Apache and MySQL Server.
